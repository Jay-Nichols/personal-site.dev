		<p>In a perfect world, Izzy and Steven would be sharing the stage with Axl, Duff, and Slash. In the minds of most diehard fans, that is the true Guns N' Roses lineup. But beggars can't be choosers. That we get to see the "Big 3" together again is a miracle in itself. As long as all five are still alive (and of this writing, they are), there is still hope. My guess: they will regroup the original lineup for the 30th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction in 2017.</p>
